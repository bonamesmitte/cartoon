      <h2>About LSP</h2>
      <p>
        Lumpy Space Princess (possibly known as Lumpy Space Queen and often
        referred to by her initials, LSP) is the queen of Lumpy Space. She is
        one of the three most recurring princesses, the other two being Flame
        Princess and Princess Bubblegum. Finn and Jake have traveled to Lumpy
        Space as well as to her parents' residence after she accidentally bit
        Jake in "Trouble in Lumpy Space". According to the events in "Princess
        Day," she is not recognized by the chair of princesses, partially
        because of her dramatic attitude and the fact that she is no longer the
        heir to Lumpy Space.

      <h2>LSP's Characteristics</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Lumpy Space Princess acts like a bratty, apathetic, attention-seeking
          and willfully ignorant teenager. Lumpy Space Princess can be
          ostensibly unmoved and uncaring about what goes on around her, using
          such words as "sure," "whatever," and "fine" frequently. She can also
          be physically apathetic and unwilling to make an effort, as shown in
          "Gotcha!" when she reluctantly helped Finn and Jake carry rocks, but
          complained the entire time (even though it was only two small rocks).
        </li>
        <li>
          She prefers to be the center of attention. When people ignore her, she
          will yell things out to regain the spotlight, such as in "The Creeps"
          when she interrupted Finn by talking about her relationship with Brad.
          She also became upset (and violent) when another group performed the
          song she chose during the talent show in "Five Short Graybles," and
          again when Finn and Jake took the win out from under her.
        </li>
        <li>
          She often misinterprets things and jumps to conclusions, as shown in
          "It Came from the Nightosphere" when she saw Hot Dog Princess's soul
          being sucked into Marceline's dad's mouth, and became upset for not
          being invited to the "party." She will also create drama where none
          exists, such as in "The Monster" and "Gotcha!" where she assigns names
          and personalities to animals and insects in order to act out
          romance-driven storylines.
        </li>
        <li>
          She tends to lose her temper and make fun of people, but she can
          sometimes attempt to be nice towards others. For example, when Jake
          contracts the lumps she agrees to help and takes Finn and Jake to
          Lumpy Space for the cure in "Trouble in Lumpy Space" and was forgiving
          towards Finn after he yelled at her in the same episode. She was also
          at the hospital, apparently concerned for Princess Bubblegum, in
          "Mortal Recoil."
